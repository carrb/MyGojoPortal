    Main entry point for the application which defines the namespace of the application
    All module references must point to a single shared object:
        A reusable function will be created that can retrieve the shared object reference when called
        This function will create the shared object and through memoization "remember" it internally in connection with a key
        Create a closure around the module's objects to prevent tampering
        Create a private scope for the module where module-specific data can be defined
