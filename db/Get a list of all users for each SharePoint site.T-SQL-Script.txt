Get a list of all users for each SharePoint site


The question is… how do you identify all the site administrators? If you only have a hand full of sites, it can certainly be done manually, 
but if you dealing with a huge farm and thousands of sites, this is not practical. That is exactly where TSQL comes to the rescue. 

Now as you know, we are not allowed to directly update any of the SharePoint databases as this action would invalidate your support 
agreement with Microsoft and put your portal in an unsupported state. That doesn't mean we can't read from it. This little SQL query 
will deliver the results you are looking for: 

USE SharePoint_SITE
SELECT w.fullurl, w.title, u.tp_title, u.tp_login
FROM webs w, userinfo u, webgroups g
INNER JOIN webgroupmembership p
ON g.webid = p.webid
AND g.id = p.groupid
WHERE g.type = 5
AND u.tp_id = p.memberid
AND u.tp_siteid = g.siteid
AND w.id = g.webid
AND w.siteid = g.siteid
ORDER BY w.fullurl 

The WebGroups table defines all the web sites and they groups that was created for each. Joining it to the WebGroupMembership table 
provides us with the users that belong to the groups and from there we just have to get more user information and web site information 
from the UserInfo and Webs tables. 

If you wish to get a list of other standard user groups, just change the "g.type =" part of the statement as follows: 

1.Guest 
2.Reader 
3.Contributor 
4.Web Designer 
5.Administrator
